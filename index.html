                    <p>I am currently looking for full time work as a Software Developer/Engineer.
                        <br><br>
                        I received a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh after graduating in April 2023. I am still available to start full-time upon completing any interview process.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of my engineering experience thus far includes: 6 month contract with InCommon Innovations LLC integrating their service with Slack via the Slack API using TypeScript, React.js, SQL and Supabase; working 3 semesters of a full-time software testing Co-op for Ansys, Inc. where I was tasked with automating testing using Python and JavaScript tests in order to validate integration of new products; completed 2 senior level design courses based around innovation, user interfacing, and group problem solving where I developed a novel algorithm for maintaining image size and shape when using a projector at odd angles; a 2 week study abroad experience in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where 20 students, including myself, studied the globalization and development, and its effects, happening in Vietnam and abroad; completed both hardware and software designs from the ground up, including a major portion of a train simulation software created as an Electron NodeJS application; application of big data and cloud computing concepts such as Bloom filters and working with vector-string embedding, and much more.</p>
